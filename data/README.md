## Data are extracted into following categories:
 - Profile features (characteristics of the user based on the profile object collected via Twitter API)
 - Activity timing (features based on the user activity pattern, such as highly active days of week or hours of day)
 - Textual (lingustic characteristics of the text)
 - Post embedding (high dimentional Neural Network embeddings based on the collected Tweet text collected via Twitter API)
 - Graph embeddings (user graph relation embeddings based on the Neural Network model)
 - Combinational (Combination of the all extracted features)


Extracted data is available via Zenodo file sharing service [https://zenodo.org/record/8404034](https://zenodo.org/record/8404034).
